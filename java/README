This is a simple sample how to use Java Native Interface to implement BOINC applications in Java programming language.

To test it, do the following:

1. adapt pathes and lib locations in Makefile so that they point to the right directories/libs
2. call make

The sample programm can started in two different ways:

a) run only the java application
	- simply call "java -Djava.library.lib=. UpperCase"

b) run the java application through the native invoker application
	- create a symbolic link to your libjvm.so used in Makefile in the current directory
	- set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to current directory and export it
	- call ./uppercase_invoke


In both cases you should get a bunch of log messages to the console, a uppercase file named "out" and a stderr.txt, that comes from boinc.
