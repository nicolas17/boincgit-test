    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.

    - Mac Client: more idle time tweaks to allow running as a daemon by 
        using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        uses Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  This requires BOINC version 
        5.10.34 or later and Mac OS 10.4 or later.
    - Mac Installer: if system is set up to run BOINC Client as a daemon 
        using launchd, use launchctl to launch newly installed Client as 
        a daemon.

    - client: a project (Ralph) had accidentally included a .svn directory in a zip archive,
        resulting in a lot of read-only files in its slot directories.
        When the client attempts to delete these files,
        each delete fails and the client retries for about 5 seconds.
        This adds up to a delay of about 20 minutes,
        during which the client (and Manager) appear to be hung.

        Solution:
        1) if a file delete fails with error ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED,
            use SetFileAttributes() to clear the read-only flag, then try again.
        2) Don't use the 5-second retry mechanism when clearing out
            slot directories.  These can contain unbounded numbers of files,
            and this can lead to long periods where the client appears hung.
