    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if 
        system supports x86_64 applications and sets HOSTTYPE and 
        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit 
        CUDA libraries.  The one other effect is that the benchmarks 
        are run in 32-bit mode even on a 64-bit capable Mac.
    - client: Async get_state RPC was not updating state.have_ati field.
    - MGR: Rebuild Advanced Menu and Taskbar Menu after connecting to 
        client, so GPU Activity and Snooze GPU items are displayed if 
        needed.
