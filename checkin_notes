    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.

    - Mac Client: more idle time tweaks to allow running as a daemon by 
        using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  
   - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        uses Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  This requires BOOINC version 
        5.10.34 or later and Mac OS 10.4 or later.
