    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if 
        system supports x86_64 applications and sets HOSTTYPE and 
        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit 
        CUDA libraries.  The one other effect is that the benchmarks 
        are run in 32-bit mode even on a 64-bit capable Mac.

    - MGR: Rebuild Advanced Menu and Taskbar Menu after connecting to

        Simple to Advanced View if using an account manager: solve this by

        of using bool argument bRPCsSafe.  Remove unused bRPCsSafe arg from 
        CAdvancedFrame::CreateNotebook(), CAdvancedFrame::CreateStatusbar().

    - client: divide LTD deltas by ninstances, same as for STD.

David  24 Dec 2009
    - client: add logic to work fetch so that each project
        will have enough jobs to use its share of resource instances.
        This avoids situations where e.g. on a 2-CPU system
        a project has 75% resource share and 1 CPU job,
        and its STD increases without bound.
        
        Did a general cleanup of the logic for computing
        work request sizes (seconds and instances).

David  5 Jan 2010
    - client: scheduling problem:
        - a project overestimates job FLOP counts
        - the client starts jobs in EDF mode
        - as job progresses and fraction done increases,
            its completion time estimate decreases until
            it's no longer a deadline miss.
        - job gets preempted by other job from that project;
            you end up with lots of partly completed jobs.
        Solution (I hope): if an app version has running jobs,
            compute a "temp DCF" for the app version,
            which is the min of dynamic/static estimates for its jobs.
            Apply this scaling factor to completion time estimates
            for unstarted jobs in RR simulation
    - client: the estimation of remaining time of running jobs was wrong
        (how did this bug survive so long?)

Charlie  26 Jan 2010
    - Mac Sandbox: The init_data.xml file in each slot directory also contains 
        an authenticator; to keep these private, change ownership of the "slots" 
        directory to boinc_master:boinc_project and eliminate read and execute 
        permissions of this directory for "other".  For consistency, make the 
        same changes to the "projects" directory.  The individual slot and 
        project directories are still world-executable and they and their 
        contents are still world-readable, so the Client can still read files 
        created by project apps with ownership boinc_project:boinc_project.
      - NOTE: I believe this should not cause any problems for either BOINC or 
        project applications, but it needs to be tested thoroughly.
