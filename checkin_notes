    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if 
        system supports x86_64 applications and sets HOSTTYPE and 
        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit 
        CUDA libraries.  The one other effect is that the benchmarks 
        are run in 32-bit mode even on a 64-bit capable Mac.
    - client: Async get_state RPC was not updating state.have_ati field.
    - MGR: Rebuild Advanced Menu and Taskbar Menu after connecting to 
        client, so GPU Activity and Snooze GPU items are displayed if 
        needed.

    - client sandbox: set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in switcher.
        For unknown reasons, the these 2 environment variables are not 
        passed in to switcher, though all other environment variables do get 
        propagated.

    - MGR: The fix of 14 Oct 2009 for "initial first connection problem on 
        startup" caused the Tools menu to be incorrect when switching from 
        Simple to Advanced View if using an account manager: solve this by 
        calling pDoc->IsConnected() in CAdvancedFrame::CreateMenu() isntead 
        of using bool argument bRPCsSafe.  Remove unused bRPCsSafe arg from 
        CAdvancedFrame::CreateNotebook(), CAdvancedFrame::CreateStatusbar().
