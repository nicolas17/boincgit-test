    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.

    - Mac Client: more idle time tweaks to allow running as a daemon by 
        using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        uses Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  This requires BOINC version 
        5.10.34 or later and Mac OS 10.4 or later.
    - Mac Installer: if system is set up to run BOINC Client as a daemon 
        using launchd, use launchctl to launch newly installed Client as 
        a daemon.

        allow time for daemon to launch.

    - client, Win: check for two process exit codes (0x40010004 and 0xc000013a)
        that appear to happen when the process is killed externally;
        seems to happen mostly or entirely on Vista

    - MGR: display MSG_USER_ERROR messages in red, all others in black 
        in both SimpleGUI and Advanced GUI message dialogs; eliminate 
        unused FormatPriority method.  
    - MGR: Auto-scroll messages only if already at bottom of list (don't 
        jump to bottom while examining earlier messages.)
    NOTE: these changes may need to be fixed in CViewMessagesGrid class 
            if we implement that in teh future.
