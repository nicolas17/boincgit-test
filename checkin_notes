    - client: Eliminate x86_64 Mac client; i386 client determines if 
        system supports x86_64 applications and sets HOSTTYPE and 
        platform accordingly.  This allows us to link with the 32-bit 
        CUDA libraries.  The one other effect is that the benchmarks 
        are run in 32-bit mode even on a 64-bit capable Mac.
    - client: Async get_state RPC was not updating state.have_ati field.
    - MGR: Rebuild Advanced Menu and Taskbar Menu after connecting to 
        client, so GPU Activity and Snooze GPU items are displayed if 
        needed.

    - MGR: The fix of 14 Oct 2009 for "initial first connection problem on 
        startup" caused the Tools menu to be incorrect when switching from 
        Simple to Advanced View if using an account manager: solve this by 
        calling pDoc->IsConnected() in CAdvancedFrame::CreateMenu() isntead 
        of using bool argument bRPCsSafe.  Remove unused bRPCsSafe arg from 
        CAdvancedFrame::CreateNotebook(), CAdvancedFrame::CreateStatusbar().

    - client: divide LTD deltas by ninstances, same as for STD.
        This is cosmetic - it won't affect work fetch,
        but it will prevent LTD from changing faster than real time

    client/
        work_fetch.cpp

David  24 Dec 2009
    - client: add logic to work fetch so that each project
        will have enough jobs to use its share of resource instances.
        This avoids situations where e.g. on a 2-CPU system
        a project has 75% resource share and 1 CPU job,
        and its STD increases without bound.
        
        Did a general cleanup of the logic for computing
        work request sizes (seconds and instances).

David  5 Jan 2010
    - client: scheduling problem:
        - a project overestimates job FLOP counts
        - the client starts jobs in EDF mode
        - as job progresses and fraction done increases,
            its completion time estimate decreases until
            it's no longer a deadline miss.
        - job gets preempted by other job from that project;
            you end up with lots of partly completed jobs.
        Solution (I hope): if an app version has running jobs,
            compute a "temp DCF" for the app version,
            which is the min of dynamic/static estimates for its jobs.
            Apply this scaling factor to completion time estimates
            for unstarted jobs in RR simulation
    - client: the estimation of remaining time of running jobs was wrong
        (how did this bug survive so long?)

    - client: add <stderr_head> config option;
        sends the first rather than last 64KB of stderr to server.
        This doesn't belong here; this choice should come from the server.
        I may take this out later.
