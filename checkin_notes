David  7 April 2006
    - extended upper_case so that it draws graphics
        (text, image, bouncing ball)
        NOTE: to get this to work, you have to put in your build dir:
            - file called "logo.jpg" (the image)
            - Helvetica.txf
            - a file called "in" (any old text)
    - added text functions to library

    - Mac: updated XCode project for upper_case, fixed 
        jconfig.h to be cross-platform.  upper_case now 
        works fully on Intel and PowerPC Macs.

David  14 June 2006
	- debugged and updated "wrapper" program.
		It works now, more or less, on Windows.
		- wrapper no longer copies input/output files.
			You must use the <copy_file/> attribute
			in the file reference instead.
		- attempted to have wrapper pass stderr handle to worker
			(Windows).  Doesn't work yet.

David  4 Nov 2006
    - uppercase: call boinc_graphics_possible() instead of
        using a bunch of mysterious inline code.
        This is supposed to be a good example, not a bad one.

Rom    6 Nov 2006
    - Checkin VS 2003 project files.

David  8 Nov 2006
	- The upper_case project file (but not the others)
		needs GDI32.DLL;OPENGL32.DLL;GLU32.DLL in its list
		of Delay Loaded DLLs (Linker properties),
		and delayimp.lib in its Additional Dependencies
